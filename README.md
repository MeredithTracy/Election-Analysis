We were asked to find:
1. Total number of votes cast.
2. Complete list of the candidates who received votes. 
3. Complete list of counties involved. 
4. Total number of votes cast for each candidate.
5. Percentage of votes each candidate received.
6. Total number of votes cast in each county.
7. Percentage of votes cast for each county.
8. County with the largest number of votes.
9. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Summary of Results
This analysis process was able to breakdown the data we received quickly and easily. This script could be used for larger and more expansive elections in the future as well. With some manipulation, you could look at the breakdown of the percentage for each candidate looks within each county to see if there were trends within each county. If we had zip codes, we could use that to further breakdown where voter turnout is highest and what areas need support to bring up voter turnout in future elections. This data could be expanded and could be a remarkable tool for the Colorado Board of Elections to use in the future.
